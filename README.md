[Get lost in a stream of words.](https://octets.eu)

## Motivation

What humans distinguishes from animals is the use of natural languages. We have an buid-in urgency to make sense of the words presented in any way. This app confronts you with an endless stream of words in a random order, only guarded by the probabilty distribution of the top 10k words according the [corpus](https://www.wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/English) of 10k most frequent English words in 2012 compiled by the UNI Leipzig.

Despite the random order you'll find word sequences hitting a nerve. What does the machine might want tell you?

Unexpected bonus: after about 1 minute staring at the screen your keyboard will bend.

## Development

This was build using [Mootools 1.3](https://mootools.net), yes, nobody talked about React or Angular these times. Hermes tries it best to run smooth with 60fps and reduces resolution if needed. Pressing 'd' gives some information.
